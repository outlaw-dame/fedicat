This repo started out as just a list of all the [Mastodon iOS apps](iosapps.md) I've found, but now it's also the github public home base for my [fediverse app](https://fedicat.com/) in progress and an associated Swift package with (hopefully) reusable code for the app, mainly [TootSDK](https://github.com/technicat/TootSDK) extensions. The current plan is to gradually move those into the TootSDK fork while migrating higher level or more app-specific code here (and then on down to TootSDK if it seems more generally useful).
