An overview of Mastodon apps I've tried on my iPhone, focusing on aspects that interest me and my design prefences (e.g. icon design, tab placements...). These apps have all been updated in the past year. Apps that seem to be no longer under development are in a [separate list](iosold.md).

Also check out the official Mastodon [list](https://joinmastodon.org/apps).

## [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/apps) by [@mastodon@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@Mastodon)

Official Mastodon app, free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974), Swift code on [Github](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-ios)

Features: fairly complete profile editing, including adding links. I use this app whenever I want to edit my profile.

Quirks: uses "reblog" instead of "boost"

## [Manny](https://actuallyzach.com/manny) by [@TaylorLineman@mastodon.social](@mastodon.social/@TaylorLineman)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/manny-for-mastodon/id1668409667)

Features: Cute appearance, elaborate app icon. Good-looking and simple sign-on screen. Interesting use of gray-shaded background (and slightly rounded corners) for boosts.

Quirks: Square avatars, account tab is not on far right, boost button has a non-obvous icon, uses "reblog" instead of "boost", non-boosted posts could use some more left side margin.

## [MetaText](https://metabolist.org/) by [@metabolist@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@metabolist)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metatext/id1523996615), Swift code on [Github](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext) (archived)

Features: Good alt-text entry interface with large multiline field that you can't ignore and offers a Detect Text (character recognition) feature. When sharing a link to this app it prepends an extracted description for the link, so I use this app as a share target for links and photos.

Quirks: No obvious indication in the feed that an image has alt-text, inconvenient path to profile (have to go through menu).

## Ice Cubes by [@dimillian@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@dimillian)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884), Swift code on [Github](https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp).

Articles on [Medium](https://dimillian.medium.com/the-making-of-ice-cubes-an-open-source-swiftui-mastodon-client-45ebea5cf6b6) and [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/ice_cubes_app_store_limbo).

Features: Excellent appearance (this and Ivory are the best looking of the bunch), full-width screen use for posts. Good hashtag completion. Most complete profile view, including links and featured hashtags. Very frequent updates.

Quirks: Single-line entry field for alt-text entry. Avatar icons are rounded square (I feel they should be round for visual distinction)

## [Mammoth](https://getmammoth.app/) by [@mammoth@moth.social](https://moth.social/@mammoth)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mammoth-for-mastodon/id1667573899), planned subscription according to this review on [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/27/mammoth-is-a-free-mastodon-app-for-ios-that-makes-it-easier-to-get-started/)

Features: A couple of built-in games, including chess. Fairly complete profile editing. Nice community (list of instances) browser.

Quirks: Have to go through menu to operate on post, no quick favorite or boost, unnecessary sound effects (that I can hear on my connected speakers)

## [Tooot](https://tooot.app/) by [xmflsct](https://xmflsct.com/)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tooot-fediverse-and-mastodon/id1549772269), react native code on [Github](https://github.com/tooot-app/app).

Features: Boost/reply filters in feed, access to local/federated/trending feeds.

Quirks: Can't remove an account.

## [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) by [@tapbots@tapbots.social](https://tapbots.social/@tapbots)

Subscription on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274) with free trial.

Features: Latest followers avatar list in profile. Clear labeling of private mentions. Extracts description when used as a link share target (although the formatting in Metatext is better).

Quirks: Prompts if you really want to boost (unnecessary hindrance to boosting freely). Alt-text entry is not available when using as a share target for images. Profile tab is in the center instead of on the right as is conventional with social media apps.

## [Mastoot](https://mastoot.app/) by [@libei@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@libei)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastoot/id1501485410).

Quirks: The profile tab on the far right is labeled ... which normally would bring you to another list of tab links.

## Tootoise by [@tootosie@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@tootoise)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootoise/id1465090190)

Quirks: No obvious way to remove an account. No guidance on entering instance name for login/signup. Rounded square avatars, paw icon (tortoise foot?) for posting, odd icons that look like pumpkin head dolls for Local and Profile

## iMast

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imast/id1229461703)

Features: Allows login option between private or external browser.

Quirks: Square avatars with no rounded corners.

## [TootDesk](https://toot.thedesk.top/)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootdesk/id1591748028), react native code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cutls/TootDesk)

Quirks: Bottom bar is more like the typical top bar, displays the username/instance in the center and icons in the corner for posting and alerts.

## [Tusker](https://vaccor.space/tusker/) by [Vaccor](https://vaccor.space/)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tusker/id1498334597), Swift code on [ShadowFacts](https://git.shadowfacts.net/shadowfacts/Tusker)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootter-for-mastodon/id1629293955)

Features: Instance browser.

Quirks: Cannot select an instance from the instance browser. Very bright color scheme, like something out of the 90s. Website is inaccessible.

## [TwidereX](https://x.twidere.com/)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twidere-x/id1530314034), Swift code on [GitHub](https://github.com/TwidereProject/TwidereX-iOS)

Features: Nice simple clean design.

## [Stella](https://www.stella-app.net/)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/stella-for-mastodon-twitter/id921372048)

Quirks: Keeps the instance front page at the top of the feed (or maybe that's a feature).
