An overview of Mastodon apps (starting with the ones I regularly use)

## [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/apps) by [@mastodon@mastodo.social](https://mastodon.social/@Mastodon)

Official Mastodon app, free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974), Swift code on [Github](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-ios)

Features: fairly complete profile editing, including adding links. I use this app whenever I want to edit my profile.

Quirks: uses "reblog" instead of "boost"

## [MetaText](https://metabolist.org/) by [@metabolist@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@metabolist)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metatext/id1523996615), Swift code on [Github](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext) (archived)

Features: Good alt-text entry interface with large multiline field that you can't ignore and offers a Detect Text (character recognition) feature. When sharing a link to this app it prepends an extracted description for the link, so I use this app as a share target for links and photos.

Quirks: No obvious indication in the feed that an image has alt-text
