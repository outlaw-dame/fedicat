An overview of Mastodon apps I've tried on my iPhone, focusing on details of particular interest to me (e.g. icon design, tab placements...). If I add more platforms, I'll split them into separate files.

## [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/apps) by [@mastodon@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@Mastodon)

Official Mastodon app, free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974), Swift code on [Github](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-ios)

Features: fairly complete profile editing, including adding links. I use this app whenever I want to edit my profile.

Quirks: uses "reblog" instead of "boost"

## [MetaText](https://metabolist.org/) by [@metabolist@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@metabolist)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metatext/id1523996615), Swift code on [Github](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext) (archived)

Features: Good alt-text entry interface with large multiline field that you can't ignore and offers a Detect Text (character recognition) feature. When sharing a link to this app it prepends an extracted description for the link, so I use this app as a share target for links and photos.

Quirks: No obvious indication in the feed that an image has alt-text, inconvenient path to profile (have to go through menu).

## Ice Cubes by [@dimillian@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@dimillian)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884), Swift code on [Github](https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp).

Articles on [Medium](https://dimillian.medium.com/the-making-of-ice-cubes-an-open-source-swiftui-mastodon-client-45ebea5cf6b6) and [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/ice_cubes_app_store_limbo).

Features: Excellent appearance, full-width screen use for posts. Good hashtag completion. Very frequent updates.

Quirks: Single-line entry field for alt-text entry. Avatar icons are square (I feel they should be round for visual distinction)

## [Mammoth](https://getmammoth.app/) by [@mammoth@moth.social](https://moth.social/@mammoth)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mammoth-for-mastodon/id1667573899), planned subscription according to this review on [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/27/mammoth-is-a-free-mastodon-app-for-ios-that-makes-it-easier-to-get-started/)

Features: A couple of built-in games, including chess. Fairly complete profile editing. Nice community (list of instances) browser.

Quirks: Have to go through menu to operate on post, no quick favorite or boost, unnecessary sound effects (that I can hear on my connected speakers)

## [Tooot](https://tooot.app/) by [xmflsct](https://xmflsct.com/)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tooot-fediverse-and-mastodon/id1549772269), react native code on [Github](https://github.com/tooot-app/app).

Features: Boost/reply filters in feed, access to local/federated/trending feeds.

Quirks: Can't remove an account.

## [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) by [@tapbots@tapbots.social](https://tapbots.social/@tapbots)

Subscription on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274) with free trial.

Features: Latest followers avatar list in profile. Clear labeling of private mentions.

Quirks: Prompts if you really want to boost (unnecessary hindrance to boosting freely). Alt-text entry is not available when using as a share target for images. Profile tab is in the center instead of on the right as is conventional with social media apps.

## [Mastoot](https://mastoot.app/) by [@libei@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@libei)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastoot/id1501485410).

Quirks: The profile tab on the far right is labeled ... which normally would bring you to another list of tab links.

## Tootoise by [@tootosie@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@tootoise)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootoise/id1465090190)

Quirks: No obvious way to remove an account. No guidance on entering instance name for login/signup. Rounded square avatars, paw icon (tortoise foot?) for posting, odd icons that look like pumpkin head dolls for Local and Profile

## iMast

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imast/id1229461703)

Features: Allows login option between private or external browser.

Quirks: Square avatars with no rounded corners.
